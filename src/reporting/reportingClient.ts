  /**
   * ---    Gets all GroupProperties for a Group.    ### Mapping ECProperties    GroupProperties define mappings from ECProperties on an iModel to columns. They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.    Content of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains two entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.    Evaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:    1. Queried properties  2. Element properties  3. Element aspect properties    Having queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.    `ECProperty` lookup is defined by three values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only one instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.    - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)  - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)  - If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)  - If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done    Class inheritance is checked if there is no wildcard value.    - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `StructuralMember`, then it will match any ECClassId which inherits `Building.StructuralMember` (e.g. `Building.Beam` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Column` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, etc)  - If `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` is a wildcard, then inheritance will not be checked    Set `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:    - A navigation property  - A struct property  - A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object  - A property inside the selected json    Names of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.    - If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected  - If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected  - If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`  - If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`    ### Authentication    Requires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:read`.

  /**
   * ---    Updates a GroupProperty for a Group.    ### Mapping ECProperties    GroupProperties define mappings from ECProperties on an iModel to columns. They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.    Content of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains two entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.    Evaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:    1. Queried properties  2. Element properties  3. Element aspect properties    Having queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.    `ECProperty` lookup is defined by three values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only one instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.    `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.    - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)  - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)  - If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)  - If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done    Class inheritance is checked if there is no wildcard value.    - If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `StructuralMember`, then it will match any ECClassId which inherits `Building.StructuralMember` (e.g. `Building.Beam` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Column` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, etc)  - If `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` is a wildcard, then inheritance will not be checked    Set `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:    - A navigation property  - A struct property  - A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object  - A property inside the selected json    Names of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.    - If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected  - If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected  - If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`  - If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`.

All rows within a single output table get the same value  - `round(x)` - returns the value of the number `x` rounded to the nearest integer  - `sign(x)` - returns the sign of the `x`, indicating whether `x` is positive (`1`), negative (`-1`), or zero (`0`)  - `sin(x)` - returns the sine of `x`  - `sinh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic sine of `x`  - `sqrt(x)` - returns the positive square root of `x`  - `tan(x)` - returns the tangent of `x`  - `tanh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic tangent of `x`  - `trunc(x)` - returns the integer portion of `x`, removing any fractional digits    Examples of supported formulas:    - `min(A * B, B * C, A * C)` - if `A`, `B`, and `C` are 3 different lengths of box edges, then this formula will result in the smallest side surface area of that box  - `min * max` - formula does not have parenthesis after function names, so the `min` and `max` operands are treated as variables (other columns), not as functions. If the Group has columns `min` and `max`, and their values are `2` and `5`, then the result of this formula is `10` for that row  - `2 ** 3` - 2 raised to the power of 3. Result will be 8. This can also be written as `pow(2, 3)`  - `min(cos(X), sin(X))` - function nesting is supported  - `A * (B + C)` - `A` multiplied by the sum of `B` and `C`  - `A * B + C` - same as `(A * B) + C`    ### Authentication    Requires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:modify`.
